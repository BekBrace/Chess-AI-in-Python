Hello friends 🙂

Today is the perfect chance as it is snowing outside,

and when it snows, I feel more in the mood to write code

and share with you intersting programs that we can write

in Python or Node js.

This is going to be a long vide - probably - as we are

going to write three files, maybe four ... hmmm let's see:

1- File for the board itself

2- File for the pieces

3- File for the AI mechanism

4- And the last main file 🙂 I was right after all, 4 😁

Ok. Prepare your terminal, your coffee, chocolate or tea 

and let us write a Chess AI software that you can play 

in your terminal.

BTW, CLI is an acronym which means Command Line Interface.

Let's get back to main.py now. 👍👌

So this it, folks 🙂

We are done with our code, now it's time for testing.

One very important thing : 

Do not think that I wrote all of that from my head.

I have serached, studied, tried, failed, tried again several codes, tried to find a solution for a problem that existed in 

almost every code block.

So, this is very polished outcome 👍🙂

Thank You !

Let us try our Chess Ai Game in our Command Line Interface 🙂👍
